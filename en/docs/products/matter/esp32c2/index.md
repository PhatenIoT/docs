# Product Overview
ESP8684 Series Each Wi-Fi + Bluetooth® 5 (LE) System-on-Chip with ultra-low power consumption.

The ESP8684 series are extremely low-power, highly integrated MCU system-on-chips (SoCs) with integrated 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and low-power Bluetooth®LE wireless communications designed for a wide range of applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT), smart home, industrial automation, healthcare, and consumer electronics with industry-leading low-power performance and RF performance. performance.

The ESP8684 series features a RISC-V 32-bit single-core processor that operates at up to 120 MHz and supports secondary development without the need for additional microcontrollers or processors.
The ESP8684 series is the industry's most powerful

The ESP8684 series is the industry's leading integrated Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 5 (LE) solution, incorporating complete transmit/receive RF functionality, including antenna switches, RF baluns, power amplifiers, low-noise amplifiers, filters, power management modules, and advanced self-calibration circuitry, dramatically reducing printed circuit board (PCB) footprint.
The ESP8684 family of chips also integrates

The ESP8684 family of chips also integrates advanced self-calibration circuitry, which realizes dynamic auto tuning to eliminate external circuitry defects and better adapt to changes in the external environment.
The ESP8684 series also incorporates advanced self-calibration circuitry that enables dynamic auto-adjustment, eliminating defects in external circuitry and better adapting to changes in the external environment. As a result, mass production of the ESP8684 does not require expensive dedicated Wi-Fi test equipment.
