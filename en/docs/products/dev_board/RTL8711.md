## 2 Features and Specifications

- **Dual-Band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Support**: Supports WLAN dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) and Bluetooth 5.0 Low Energy (BLE). The module integrates the Real-M300 high-performance MCU, WLAN MAC, baseband, RF, and Bluetooth functionalities, enabling complete Wi-Fi and BLE 5.0 protocol support.

- **Multiple Operating Modes and Power-Saving Mechanisms**: Operating voltage range of 3.0V to 3.6V, supporting various low-power modes such as sleep mode and deep sleep mode. In different modes, each functional module can flexibly configure power and clocks to reduce power consumption. For example, in sleep mode, most functional modules can be power-gated or clock-gated; in deep sleep mode, all functions are shut down except for AON (Always-On) functionality, achieving ultra-low power consumption.

- **Rich Interface Resources**: Provides configurable GPIO pins for controlling peripheral devices. It also integrates internal memory to support simple application development. The module offers multiple communication interfaces, such as UART, SPI, QSPI/OSPI, I2C, and high-speed connection interfaces like SDIO and USB, as well as audio functions (including digital microphone interface and I2S).

- **High-Performance Processors**: The module includes a low-power KM4 MCU (based on the Armv8.1-M architecture, compatible with the Cortex-M55 instruction set), with a maximum clock speed of 345MHz. The KM4 processor offers enhanced debugging features, floating-point computation, digital signal processing (DSP) extension instructions, etc. Additionally, it includes a low-power KM0 MCU (based on the Armv8-M baseline architecture, compatible with the Cortex-M23 instruction set), with a maximum clock speed of 115MHz. The KM0 processor features a simplified instruction set and smaller code size, compatible with KM4 processor code and tools, making it ideal for power-sensitive, fast-response tasks such as power management and network protocol handling.

- **Reliable RF Performance**:
  - **Wi-Fi RF Features**: In the 2.4GHz frequency band, the module follows the IEEE 802.11b/g/n standards, supporting multiple modulation schemes and data rates, with good transmission power and reception sensitivity. In the 5GHz band, it follows the IEEE 802.11a/n standards, providing excellent transmission and reception performance. The antenna supports diversity functions, allowing the external RF switch to select the best antenna to reduce channel fading effects. The module also features real-time calibration to ensure stable operation of the radio system.
  - **Bluetooth RF Features**: Compliant with Bluetooth 5.0 specifications, operating in the 2.4GHz frequency band. The module offers good transmission power and reception sensitivity, supporting various Bluetooth functions such as fast AGC control, multiple power levels, enhanced power control, and low-power modes (such as BLE).
