## 3. Modify the RX Device MAC

### 3.1 Manual Modification of the 8711 Module's MAC Address

Modify the MAC addresses for the RX 8711 module (connected to the speaker); both WiFi and Bluetooth MAC addresses need to be changed.

### 3.2 Prerequisites

Ensure the firmware has been burned, and reset the device (press the CHIP button). It will automatically enter MP mode.

![Reset Device](../../../assets/images/a316-8711-5.1make/12.png){width=300}

### 3.3 Using the MAC Modification Tool

Download the MAC modification tool [Click to Download AmebaDPlus_MP_tool_1V6(164576)](../../../assets/download/a316-8711-5.1make/AmebaDPlus_MP_tool_1V6(164576).7z)

Download the MAC address reference file [Click to Download](../../../assets/download/a316-8711-5.1make/rx-mac.txt.zip): Use this file to retrieve the necessary MAC addresses. Make sure to modify the MAC address according to the channel for the respective device. Do not use duplicate MAC addresses.

Note: The tool can only modify one RX at a time. Ensure the device is connected and the firmware is loaded before opening the tool.

1. Configure the file and verify that it is correct.

![Configuration Step 1](../../../assets/images/a316-8711-5.1make/13.png){width=300} ![Configuration Step 2](../../../assets/images/a316-8711-5.1make/14.png){width=300}

2. Open the exe file and ensure the options match the image below.

3. Open the ini file using Notepad and ensure the parameters are aligned as shown in the image.

![INI File Configuration](../../../assets/images/a316-8711-5.1make/16.png){width=300}

4. Once the steps are confirmed, connect the serial port to the device, ensuring the device is in the MP mode, then open the tool.

![Serial Port Connection](../../../assets/images/a316-8711-5.1make/17.png){width=300}

5. After opening the tool, the serial port number should be automatically recognized. Click "Refresh".

6. Go to "Efuse" and click the "Read" button.

![Read Efuse](../../../assets/images/a316-8711-5.1make/19.png){width=300}

7. Retrieve the required MAC address and input it into the "MAC Address" field.

The address corresponds to row "11".

![MAC Address Entry](../../../assets/images/a316-8711-5.1make/20.png){width=300}

8. Modify the Bluetooth MAC in row "1B", where the value is the MAC address from step 7 incremented by 1.

![Bluetooth MAC Modification](../../../assets/images/a316-8711-5.1make/21.png){width=300}

9. After modification, click "Update", "Program", and "Save mapfile".

![Save and Program](../../../assets/images/a316-8711-5.1make/22.png){width=300}

10. After saving, reset the device (press the CHIP button or power cycle it), then click "Read" again to verify that the MAC has been successfully modified.

It is recommended to label the devices to distinguish between different channel types.

| ---------------------- |-----------|
| SCLK | DOUT      |
| DTAT,0 | WS        |
| LRCLK | DIN       |
| X0D37 | PB22      |
| I2C-SCL | PB3       |
| I2C-SDA | MCLK      |

## 4.2 Connecting Devices

After burning the firmware, connect each 8711 development board to the serial port, send the AT+OTACLEAR command, and reset the device. This will put it into Normal mode.

Once both TX and RX are powered on, they will automatically pair with each other. For the first pairing, only the current devices should be nearby.

Each 8711 (RX) should print the following log to indicate successful connection:
