## Matter Products
Matter is primarily aimed at the smart home market, and is primarily positioned for the following device types.

- Lighting and electrical devices: e.g. switches, lights, outlets.
- HVAC devices: e.g. air conditioners, heaters.
- Security devices: e.g. alarms, cameras.
- Access control devices: e.g. smart door locks, TVs, curtains
- Bridges: Bridges refer to bridging devices from non-Matter networks to Matter networks.

## Strengths
Matter's vision is to give consumers, developers and retailers a better experience in four areas.

- Simplicity: make it easier for users to choose which smart home products to buy and use.

- Interoperability: allowing devices from different manufacturers to be interconnected and compatible between ecosystems. For consumers, the Multi-Admin feature provided by Matter allows users to connect their devices to multiple ecosystems at the same time, and users are free to choose their favourite ecosystems and switch freely.

- Reliability: Maintains the stability of the local connection, and is able to respond to user control commands in a timely manner, regardless of whether the device is a sleeping or non-sleeping device.

- Security: Matter adds a number of security features to simplify user control while still maintaining a high level of security, ensuring that user information is not compromised.
