### 1. The Relationship Between Matter Smart Products and Matter Smart Modules

Matter smart products refer to various smart home devices aimed at end-users, such as smart lighting, smart locks, and smart cameras. They are designed to meet different needs in home life through intelligent functions, enabling convenient operations like remote control and automated scene settings. However, the realization of these diverse functionalities does not come from thin air; it heavily relies on Matter smart modules.

Matter smart modules can be considered the "intelligent core" of Matter smart products. They integrate a series of key technologies and components, including but not limited to communication chips, sensor interfaces, microcontrollers, and related software protocol stacks. These elements work together to enable smart products to communicate and interact seamlessly with other devices that adhere to the Matter protocol. Specifically, Matter smart modules are responsible for handling wireless connections between devices, ensuring stable and efficient data transmission, thus achieving interconnectivity among smart products. For example, when users control multiple Matter smart products through a mobile app to create an automated scene, such as unlocking the smart door lock, turning on the lights, and drawing the curtains in "Home Mode," it is the Matter smart modules that silently support accurate information transfer and coordinated actions among these devices.

In summary, Matter smart modules provide the "intelligent" soul for Matter smart products, making them essential for functioning within the smart home ecosystem. The two are closely connected and indispensable to each other.
