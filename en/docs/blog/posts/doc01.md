## **Smart Lighting Products**:
- **Nanoleaf Smart Lighting Series**: Nanoleaf has launched several Matter-compatible smart lighting products, including smart multi-color light strips, smart multi-color outdoor string lights, and smart multi-color permanent outdoor lights. These fixtures offer a wide range of colors with over 16 million options and various shades of white, controllable via related apps or voice commands, allowing users to create personalized lighting scenes.
- **Phaten Smart Bulbs**: Phaten’s smart bulbs have made a mark in the market with their advanced technology. Leveraging Phaten's powerful wireless communication module technology, these bulbs offer efficient connectivity. Users can easily check the bulb's status, including color, brightness, and power consumption, from their smartphones anytime and anywhere. The bulbs also support remote adjustment, allowing users to set lighting according to their personal color preferences. In scenarios with multiple bulbs, they can automatically network and coordinate to meet customized lighting needs for different room settings.
- **Rakuten Smart LED Bulbs Matter Edition**: This bulb offers more scene choices for smart homes. Supporting the Matter protocol, it integrates seamlessly into Apple's smart ecosystem without the need for additional hubs. In addition to Apple Home, it can connect seamlessly with Samsung SmartThings, Tuya, Aqara Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, HomeAssistant, and other major platforms, achieving true smart home interoperability. It has an adjustable color temperature range from 2700K to 6500K, and brightness can be adjusted from 1% to 100%, with 16 million RGB color options to suit various lighting needs.

## **Sensor Products**:
- **Rakuten Human Presence Sensor**: The world’s first Matter human presence sensor uses millimeter-wave radar technology and a six-in-one detection mode, including millimeter-wave radar, infrared thermopile detection, Bluetooth beacon-assisted detection, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, and light sensor. Compared to traditional infrared sensors, it solves the problem of detecting only movement, offering higher precision. It is compact and supports various installation methods, powered via USB-C for ease of use.
- **Eve Door and Window Sensor**: This sensor can monitor the open and close status of doors and windows in real-time and feedback the information to the user's smart devices. By integrating with other Matter devices, it can automatically trigger corresponding scenes based on the status of doors and windows, such as turning on the lights when a door opens or turning off the air conditioner when a window closes, providing strong security and energy-saving benefits for home management.

## **Smart Plugs**:
- **Phaten Smart Plug**: Phaten’s smart plug excels in its performance. It supports multiple control methods, allowing users to operate it via smartphone apps or voice commands, providing convenience. It features scheduling capabilities, enabling users to set timers to turn connected devices on or off at specific times, facilitating automated energy management and saving energy. Additionally, the smart plug monitors energy usage, giving users a clear view of their home’s energy consumption for better management.
- **Other Brand Smart Plugs**: Other brands also offer smart plugs with unique features. For example, some have various safety protection functions such as overload protection and over-voltage protection to ensure electrical safety. Some integrate USB charging ports, making it easy to charge devices like smartphones and tablets. Matter smart plugs allow remote control of connected devices, enabling users to turn off all devices when leaving home and preheat or activate appliances like heaters and humidifiers before returning, enhancing convenience and energy efficiency.

## **Smart Locks**:

Matter smart locks support multiple unlocking methods such as fingerprint recognition, password input, and smartphone Bluetooth connection. They can also interact with other smart home devices. For instance, when a user unlocks the smart lock with their fingerprint, the home's lights can automatically turn on, and the air conditioning can adjust to a comfortable temperature, providing a more convenient and comfortable home experience. Some smart locks even include doorbell functions, allowing users to view the door area via their phone or smart display and remotely control the lock.

## **Gateway Devices**:

Matter gateways serve as a bridge to connect different protocols and technologies, allowing various smart devices to work together within the Matter ecosystem. By connecting through a Matter gateway, users can seamlessly integrate existing smart home devices into the unified Matter protocol management, enabling interaction and control between devices that do not originally support Matter, such as Zigbee or Bluetooth devices.

As technology continues to advance and the market expands, more diverse and powerful Matter products will emerge, bringing users a more convenient and intelligent home living experience.
