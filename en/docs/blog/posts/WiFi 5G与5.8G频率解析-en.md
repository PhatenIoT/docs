# “5G” and “5.8G” in WiFi: Unveiling the Secrets of Wireless Network Frequencies




Today, WiFi has become an indispensable part of our lives. Whether it’s binge-watching shows, gaming, or remote working, a stable internet connection is essential. However, many people may feel confused when they see options like “2.4G,” “5G,” or even “5.8G” in their router settings <!-- more -->: 

- **What do these numbers actually represent?** 
- **How do they affect speed and signal?** 
- **Is this the same as mobile 5G networks?** 




This article will analyze these concepts from a scientific perspective to help everyone better understand the underlying logic of wireless networks.

### **1. What is "5G" in WiFi?**




#### **1. Not the mobile 5G, but the 5GHz frequency band**
What we commonly refer to as “WiFi 5G” actually indicates the **5GHz (Gigahertz) wireless frequency band**, which is completely unrelated to the “fifth generation mobile network (5G).” 

**2.4GHz vs 5GHz**: 

 WiFi routers usually support two frequency bands: 

 - **2.4GHz**: Offers wider coverage and better penetration, but faces more interference (devices like Bluetooth and microwaves also use this band), and speeds are slower. 
 - **5GHz**: Provides greater bandwidth, less interference, and is suitable for high-speed transmission, but the signal degrades faster and has a smaller coverage area. 




#### **2. Why is the 5GHz band needed?**
With the increasing number of smart devices, the 2.4GHz band is becoming increasingly congested. For example, a household may have dozens of devices connected at the same time, leading to network lags.

**Advantages of 5GHz**: 

 - Provides wider channels (e.g., 80MHz, 160MHz) for faster transmission speeds. 
 - Offers more available channels (2.4GHz has only 3 non-overlapping channels, while 5GHz has dozens), reducing interference.

### **2. What about “5.8G” in hardware?**




#### **1. 5.8GHz is part of the 5GHz band**
5GHz is not a single frequency but a range (typically **5.150–5.850GHz**). Different countries categorize this band into several sub-bands. For example: 

- **China**: 5.725–5.850GHz (i.e., “5.8G”). 
- **USA**: 5.150–5.825GHz. 




When some routers indicate support for “5.8G,” it means they cover the higher frequency portion of the 5GHz band.




#### **2. Characteristics of the high-band frequency**

- **Faster speeds but more significant degradation**: 
 Higher frequencies carry more data (like having more lanes on a highway), but they degrade more quickly when encountering obstacles (such as walls and furniture). 
- **Impact of transmission power**: 
 Some devices may increase transmission power (e.g., from 100mW to 200mW) to compensate for the coverage issues of high-frequency signals, but this must comply with local regulations (e.g., China limits the transmission power in the 5.8GHz band).

### **3. Key Differences: 5G vs 5.8G**




| **Comparison Dimension**  | **WiFi 5G (5GHz)**    | **5.8G in Hardware (5.8GHz)** |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Definition**    | Entire 5GHz band        | High-frequency sub-band of 5GHz    |
| **Coverage Range**  | Medium (smaller than 2.4GHz)  | Smaller (high frequencies degrade faster)    |
| **Applicable Scenarios**  | Close-range high-speed transmission (e.g., 4K video) | Short-distance extreme demands (e.g., VR devices) |
| **Device Compatibility** | Supported by most devices    | Supported by some high-end routers or devices  |

### **4. How to Choose the Right Frequency Band?**




#### **1. Choose Based on Needs**

**Select 2.4GHz**: 

 - When you need to penetrate walls or cover large areas (like villas or multi-story homes). 
 - When connecting low-speed devices like smart home gadgets. 

**Select 5GHz/5.8GHz**: 

 - When devices are near the router (like a desktop in the study or gaming consoles). 
 - When you need high-speed, low-latency connections (like online meetings or competitive gaming). 




#### **2. Dual-band Routers are the Trend**
Modern routers mainly support **dual-band integration (2.4GHz + 5GHz automatic switching)**, where devices will automatically select the best frequency band based on distance and interference. When making manual settings, consider the following recommendations: 

- **Smart Home Devices**: Fixed connection to 2.4GHz. 
- **Mobile Phones/Computers**: Prefer connecting to 5GHz. 




#### **3. Pay Attention to Regulatory Restrictions**
Different countries impose strict regulations on the use of the 5.8GHz sub-band. For example: 

- **China**: The maximum allowable transmission power for the 5.8GHz band is 200mW. 
- **EU**: Some bands must support DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) to avoid interference with radar signals. When purchasing routers for cross-border use, ensure compliance with local regulations.

### **5. Future Outlook: How Will WiFi Technology Evolve?**




1.**The Popularity of WiFi 6/6E**: 

 - WiFi 6 supports the 6GHz band (not yet available in China), providing wider channels and lower latency. 
 - Future devices may support 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz simultaneously. 




2.**Challenges of High-Frequency Bands**: 

 As frequency bands increase (like millimeter waves), signal coverage issues will become more pronounced, requiring reliance on technologies like Mesh networking and smart antennas to overcome limitations.

### **Conclusion** 
- **WiFi 5G = 5GHz band**: Addresses the congestion of 2.4GHz and offers high-speed channels. 
- **5.8G = 5.8GHz frequency**: A high-frequency part of 5GHz, offering extreme speeds but limited coverage. 
- **Utilize Dual-Band Wisely**: Selecting frequency bands according to scenarios can truly maximize WiFi performance. 




Next time you set up your router, consider manually allocating frequency bands, and you may find a significant improvement in your network experience!
