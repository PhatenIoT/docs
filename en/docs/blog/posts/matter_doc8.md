# Matter: The Rising Star in the Smart Home Ecosystem! Steady Development
<!-- more -->
## Matter Market Sales
As a rising star in the smart home ecosystem, Matter smart sockets are gradually emerging in the market. According to the latest market analysis, the smart plug market is expected to grow from $2.69 billion to $9.12 billion, with a compound annual growth rate of 27.66% during the forecast period. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the fastest-growing market, while North America is the largest market.

## Advantages of Matter
The technical advantage of Matter smart sockets lies in its IP-based architecture, which can support various communication protocols including Wi-Fi, Thread, Bluetooth, etc., to achieve efficient interconnection between different devices. This efficient interconnection capability, coupled with the open-source nature of the Matter protocol and the policy of waiving patent fees, helps to reduce the development costs for companies and promotes the emergence of more innovative products.

## Development of Matter in China

In terms of domestic enterprises and product layout, the acceptance of the Matter protocol by companies is gradually increasing. Companies including Tuya Smart, Aqara Green Rice, and Orebo have begun to launch products that support the Matter protocol. Aqara Green Rice is expected to complete support for Matter in more than 10 product categories and 160+ SKU products by 2023, demonstrating its strategic layout in the field of Matter whole-house intelligence.

Although the promotion of the Matter protocol in the domestic market still faces some challenges, such as market fragmentation and ecological barriers, with the continuous maturity and expansion of the application range of the Matter protocol, it is expected to bring new growth opportunities to the domestic smart home market. The promotion of the Matter protocol helps to solve the long-standing compatibility issues between smart home products, improve the user experience, and also provide new business opportunities for domestic smart home manufacturers to "go global."

With the official release of the Matter 1.2 version, it is expected that more Matter smart products will enter the market, especially in categories such as smart sockets, smart lighting, and smart shading. The success of Matter smart sockets is highly likely, thanks to their technical advantages, market potential, and active participation of domestic enterprises. As the Matter ecosystem continues to grow and the variety of products becomes richer, it is expected that the Matter protocol will bring broader development prospects to the smart home market.
