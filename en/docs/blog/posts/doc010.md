# Phaten Company: An Excellent Partner in Matter Module Manufacturing

The Matter standard has gained support from major ecosystem giants like Amazon, Apple, and Google in the European and American markets, leading to a relatively smooth market promotion as top companies in various categories have joined in. Since the beginning of this year, the demand for Matter orders in these markets has continued to grow.

To seize this wave of opportunity, hardware device companies have rushed to enter the market. However, they quickly realized that supporting the Matter protocol requires a comprehensive upgrade across chips, software, operating systems, testing certifications, and production management. Many companies lack the relevant experience and technical teams to accomplish this independently.

In this market context, Phaten Company has demonstrated unique advantages in the field of Matter module manufacturing through its advanced technology and professional services.

## 1. Deep Understanding and Accurate Grasp of the Matter Standard

Phaten Company has conducted in-depth research and accurately grasped the certification procedures and technical specifications of the Matter standard. We understand the importance of this standard for the integration of smart home ecosystems, and thus have made comprehensive layouts and upgrades across all aspects, from chips and software to operating systems, testing certifications, and production management, to ensure that the Matter modules we manufacture fully comply with standard requirements. This enables us to provide professional guidance and standard-compliant module products for companies looking to quickly enter the Matter market but lacking relevant experience.

## 2. Efficient Production Capability Based on Advanced Factories
