**1.Support for Audio Encoding Formats**:

- **Wide Compatibility**: It needs to support various common audio encoding formats, such as Dolby Digital, DTS (Digital Theater Systems), AAC (Advanced Audio Coding), MP3, etc., to ensure the ability to decode audio signals from different sources. This way, audio files from various media such as movies, music, and games can be correctly decoded and played.
- **High-Resolution Format Support**: For high-resolution audio formats, such as 24-bit/192 kHz and above, the decoder module should be able to support them well, presenting a more delicate and realistic audio effect to meet the high demands of users regarding sound quality.

**2.Channel Separation and Processing Technology**:

- **Precise Channel Separation**: It should accurately separate the individual channels in multichannel audio signals, ensuring that each channel's audio information is independent and complete. For example, in a 5.1 channel system, it must clearly separate the signals of the left front, right front, center, left surround, right surround, and subwoofer channels, avoiding signal interference and confusion between channels to achieve accurate sound positioning and surround effects.
- **Channel Balance and Adjustment**: It should have the capability to independently adjust parameters such as volume, phase, and delay for each channel. This allows for personalized settings based on different usage scenarios and user needs to achieve the best audio effect. For instance, in a home theater environment, the delay of surround channels can be adjusted based on the room layout and seating position, allowing the audience to experience a more realistic surround sound effect.

**3.Digital Signal Processing Capability**:

- **Filtering and Noise Reduction**: It should have a built-in high-performance digital filter that can filter audio signals to remove unwanted frequency components, such as noise and interference. At the same time, effective noise reduction technology should be employed to lower background noise in audio signals, improving the signal-to-noise ratio and making the sound clearer and purer.
- **Audio Effects Processing**: It should support various audio effects processing functions, such as equalizers, reverb, and virtual surround sound. The equalizer can adjust the volume of different frequency bands to meet user needs for various music styles or audio scenarios; the reverb function can simulate different acoustic environments, enhancing the spatial sense of audio; virtual surround sound technology can simulate multichannel surround effects on a two-channel audio system, enhancing audio immersion.

**4.Real-Time Processing and Low Latency**:

- **Fast Signal Processing Speed**: It should be able to quickly decode and process input audio data to ensure real-time playback of audio signals. This is particularly important for applications that require high real-time performance, such as gaming, video conferencing, and live streaming, where low-latency audio processing ensures synchronization between audio and video or other real-time signals, avoiding sound lag or desynchronization.
- **Efficient Buffer Management**: It should adopt a reasonable buffering mechanism to cache and pre-read input audio data, reducing latency during data transmission and processing. At the same time, it should ensure that the buffer size and management strategy can adapt to different audio data sources and playback scenarios, avoiding buffer overflow or data loss issues.

**5.Interfaces and Connectivity**:

- **Rich Input Interfaces**: It should have various audio input interfaces, such as optical, coaxial, HDMI, USB, etc., to connect different audio devices and data sources. For example, optical and coaxial interfaces are commonly used to connect digital audio devices, such as Blu-ray players and digital TV set-top boxes; HDMI can transmit both audio and video signals simultaneously, suitable for home theater systems; USB interfaces facilitate connections with computers, smartphones, and other devices.
- **Good Compatibility and Expandability**: Interfaces should comply with relevant audio standards and specifications to ensure compatibility with different brands and models of audio devices. Additionally, the decoder module should have a certain degree of expandability, such as supporting firmware upgrades, to continuously enhance performance and add support for new audio formats and features.

**6.Power Management and Stability**:

- **Stable Power Supply**: To ensure the normal operation of the decoder module, a stable power supply is required. The power management circuit should effectively filter out noise and interference from the power supply, ensuring stable and reliable output voltage and current. It should also have over-voltage protection, over-current protection, and other functions to prevent damage to the decoder module due to power issues.
- **Low Power Consumption Design**: While meeting performance requirements, a low-power design scheme should be adopted to reduce the energy consumption of the decoder module. This is particularly important for portable audio devices or applications sensitive to power consumption, as it can extend the device's usage time and battery life.
