# Feiteng Cloud: 8720DF SRRC Certification

SRRC (State Radio Regulation of China) certification is a mandatory certification mark issued by China's National Radio Administration (NCA). <!-- more -->This certification applies to all radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment sold or used within China. The purpose of SRRC certification is to ensure that devices comply with China's radio spectrum management regulations and technical standards, reducing interference and ensuring device safety.

To obtain SRRC certification, a series of tests must be conducted to ensure compliance with relevant technical specifications and requirements. These tests may include Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC), radio frequency performance, and safety performance tests. Applicants must conduct tests at SRRC accredited laboratories in China and submit relevant application documents and test reports to the NCA.

Prior to SRRC certification, applicants typically need to obtain relevant production licenses, and devices must comply with relevant Chinese technical standards. Sometimes, local agents or consulting companies are required to assist with document handling and testing matters. Only products that successfully pass SRRC certification can be legally sold and used in the Chinese market.
