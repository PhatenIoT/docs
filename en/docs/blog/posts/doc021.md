### 9.1 Home Theater Surround System

The 9.1.2 home theater system setup differs slightly from the 9.1 system. While it might seem like the only difference is the addition of two ceiling or upward-firing speakers, the 9.1.2 system actually replaces the two front vertical speakers with two front wide speakers, in addition to the two ceiling or upward-firing speakers.
