## 4. Achievements and Applications of the Cooperation




The collaboration has yielded remarkable results, with several innovative technologies developed together, covering cutting-edge areas such as AI dynamic noise reduction, DSP audio effects, Hi-Fi Audio Bridge, and spatial audio.




### (1) AI Dynamic Noise Reduction Technology (DNR)




This technology acts like a magical audio wizard, widely applicable to USB microphones, headphones, sound cards, and other devices. It can intelligently identify and effectively eliminate various types of noise in the environment, allowing users to enjoy pure and clear sound whether in a noisy street or a bustling office, as if they were in a tranquil private space.




### (2) DSP Audio Effects (Reverb, EQ Equalization, etc.)




For applications such as live streaming sound cards, live microphones, and digital broadcasting, DSP audio effects are undoubtedly powerful assistants in enhancing audio quality. With precise reverb effects and detailed EQ adjustments, users can easily create professional-grade audio effects tailored to their preferences and scene requirements, adding richness to activities like live streaming and music appreciation.




### (3) Hi-Fi Audio Bridge Technology (USB Audio Bridging, ASRC, SPDIF to I2S, etc.)




This technology plays a crucial role in high-quality audio decoders, amplifiers, and other devices. It enables lossless transmission and conversion of audio signals, presenting users with a high-fidelity audio feast where every note flows authentically, satisfying audiophiles' ultimate pursuit of sound quality.




### (4) Spatial Audio Technology (Virtual 7.1, 7.1.4, Stereo Sound Field Optimization, etc.)




In gaming headsets, gaming decoders, USB dongles, and other devices, spatial audio technology shines. It simulates realistic stereo sound fields, creating an immersive audio environment for gamers, allowing them to capture sound details in the game more keenly, thus gaining an edge in intense gaming competition.
