## **(I) Linear Microphone Array: The Simple Yet Powerful "Pioneer" of Sound**

The linear microphone array is presented to us in a clear and straightforward arrangement, with microphones arranged linearly at regular intervals, resembling a straight "track" for sound. This array structure is like a modest artist, standing out among various microphone array types due to its minimalist style and ease of implementation. Additionally, it offers excellent directionality, acting like a sharp-eyed navigator, capable of accurately pointing to the sound source within a certain range.

On the broad stage of real-world applications, the linear microphone array can be seen as an active "star," widely used in popular scenarios such as video conferencing and smart speakers. Its advantages are like a dazzling gem: its simple structure allows for smooth installation and arrangement, while its good directionality enables it to capture target sounds with precision in specific environments. However, as with anything, it has its limitations. Due to its one-dimensional arrangement, the linear microphone array struggles when faced with complex sound-capturing tasks in three-dimensional space, much like a warrior trapped in a two-dimensional plane. It has certain limitations in capturing sounds across three-dimensional space.

## **(II) Planar Microphone Array: The Sound "Catcher" in 2D Space**

The planar microphone array is like an artist creating a sound masterpiece on a two-dimensional plane, carefully arranging the microphones according to specific rules, often in shapes like rectangles or circles, resembling a well-organized geometric pattern. This arrangement grants the array unique capabilities; it can capture sound information in a two-dimensional plane with sensitivity, and through sophisticated signal processing algorithms, it can unlock the door to sound localization information, allowing it to perceive sound directions.

In the expansive realm of large conference systems, the planar microphone array undoubtedly plays a prominent role as a "leading actor." Through intricate and skillful signal processing algorithms, much like a virtuoso conductor, it directs the array to capture and denoise sound from multiple directions, providing a high-quality audio experience for participants. This ensures that every sound is clearly transmitted to every corner of the room.

## **(III) Three-Dimensional Microphone Array: The Sound "Explorer" in 3D Space**

The three-dimensional microphone array is like a fearless explorer, bravely arranging microphones in three-dimensional space to fully embrace the sound challenges from all directions in this 3D world. With the rapid rise of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, which have opened up a new "treasure continent," the application prospects of three-dimensional microphone arrays are extremely bright.

This array functions like a precise sound "compass," capable of more accurately localizing sound sources and detecting their directions. For applications that require extremely high sound capture accuracy, such as sound field sensing in autonomous vehicles or immersive sound construction in virtual reality environments, the three-dimensional microphone array is like a tailor-made "magic tool." It offers significant advantages and provides solid, reliable acoustic support for these cutting-edge technologies.
