### **1. Matter Certification and Device Support: A Solid Foundation for Success**

Vivo Smart Living has successfully passed Matter's software certification, thanks to its outstanding technical strength and in-depth exploration of the smart home field. This certification opens the door to a broader smart home world. Currently, Vivo Smart Living has made significant achievements in device support, covering five categories: lights, sockets, curtain motors, sensors, and bridges. These device types play crucial roles in the smart home ecosystem.

The strength demonstrated by these five categories on the Connectivity Standards Alliance's official website is impressive. Over 1,200 SKUs have been certified, indicating that any brand devices belonging to these categories can seamlessly connect to Vivo smartphones and tablets with the Vivo Smart Living App installed. This extensive compatibility offers great convenience to users, allowing them to find a sense of belonging within Vivo's ecosystem, regardless of the brand of device they choose, as long as it meets the relevant category standards.

Additionally, the openness and compatibility of Vivo Smart Living are reflected in its support for devices using other protocols. Devices utilizing Zigbee and Bluetooth protocols can also connect to Vivo Smart Living through bridges. This initiative further enriches the pathways for device integration, allowing more types of smart devices to join Vivo's smart home ecosystem, creating a more diverse smart living experience for users.

### **2. Collaboration and User Experience: Working Together to Create an Ultimate Experience**

Vivo's journey in the smart home field is not a solitary one; it is a collaborative effort with numerous partners to jointly outline a grand blueprint for smart homes. Vivo has established close partnerships with over 70 brands, creating a broad cooperation network that offers users a rich variety of choices. Through collaboration with these brands, Vivo has adapted over 7,000 smart hardware products, each carefully tuned and optimized to ensure optimal performance within the Vivo Smart Living ecosystem.

To provide users with a more convenient and efficient operating experience, Vivo has meticulously crafted three operating system-level entry points for shallow products, each serving as a key to easy control of smart homes.

First is the quick network configuration feature. When the phone detects a device, a clear prompt pops up immediately, guiding users through the network configuration steps. This simple and efficient configuration method greatly enhances device activation rates, allowing users to quickly integrate new devices into their smart home systems and enjoy the convenience of smart living.

Second is the atomic components feature. Located at the desktop level, users can easily see and directly control devices with a simple swipe of the screen. This intuitive and convenient interaction method makes the interaction between users and devices feel more natural and seamless, as if the devices have become an indispensable part of their lives.

Lastly, the lock screen home component allows users to control home devices like air conditioners and TVs directly from the lock screen without unlocking their phones. Whether on a busy morning or a lazy evening, users can quickly adjust the status of home devices, enjoying a comfortable living environment.

At the same time, Vivo is actively exploring the application of artificial intelligence in smart homes, opening up the capabilities of its self-developed AI model. Based on six commonly used categories, Vivo has invested significant effort and resources to train nearly 4,000 models, carefully refining the application of smart home agents. This application allows users to operate and control home appliances through easy and natural conversations, eliminating the need to remember complex commands. This intelligent interaction method not only enhances user experience but also brings smart homes closer to people's lives.

### **3. Future Outlook: Continuous Innovation to Lead the Future of Smart Homes**

Vivo has a clear and defined plan for its development within the Matter ecosystem, acting as a visionary navigator leading the smart home ecosystem forward. In the future, Vivo will continue to expand the Matter categories, constantly exploring and uncovering the potential of more smart home devices, integrating more types of devices into its ecosystem. This will provide users with richer and more comprehensive smart home solutions, meeting their increasingly diverse needs.

Moreover, Vivo will actively support developers in customizing Matter quick application listing platforms. This initiative will encourage more developers to participate in the construction of Vivo's smart home ecosystem, stimulating innovation and injecting fresh energy into the ecosystem. Additionally, Vivo will fully integrate the AI model, further enhancing the richness and intelligence of the smart home ecosystem. By continuously optimizing and improving its technology and services, Vivo is committed to creating a more convenient, intelligent, and comfortable home living environment for users.
