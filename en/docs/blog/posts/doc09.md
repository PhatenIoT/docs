# Phaten Company 5.1 Surround Sound Module: Creating an Ultimate Audio-Visual Experience

Do you long to enjoy cinema-level sound effects at home? Phaten Company's 5.1 surround sound module will make that dream a reality.

This sound module utilizes advanced technology based on the WIFI 5.8G frequency band, which, compared to the traditional 2.4G band, experiences less interference and faster data transmission. This means you can enjoy clearer and more stable audio effects while watching movies or listening to music.

In terms of chip application, it combines the Realtek RTL8711DCM main control chip with the XMOS XU316 USB audio decoding chip. These two powerful "hearts" ensure high-quality processing and transmission of audio signals.

Its workflow is also quite ingenious. You simply connect your computer or mobile device to the XMOS XU316 USB audio decoder via a USB interface to easily access the audio source. Then, the audio signal undergoes a series of conversions and transmissions, ultimately being transmitted to each speaker via WIFI 5.8G technology, creating an immersive 5.1 channel surround sound effect for you.

This sound module also boasts many surprising features. It supports high-resolution audio, capable of processing 192KHz/24bit audio files, allowing you to hear every subtle detail in the music. Additionally, the 5.8GHz system, which uses direct-sequence spread spectrum technology, has strong anti-interference capabilities, ensuring stable sound effects even in complex environments.

Installation and usage are also very simple. The wireless design greatly reduces the hassle of wiring, allowing you to easily set up the sound system and instantly transform your home into a private cinema. It is suitable for various environments, whether at home, in the office, or in public spaces, and can operate stably.

Phaten Company's 5.1 surround sound module product, with its outstanding performance, brings you an unprecedented audio-visual experience. Whether watching thrilling blockbusters or immersing yourself in soothing music, it allows you to feel as if you are right in the middle of it all, experiencing every detail of the sound.
