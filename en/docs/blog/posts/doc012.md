### I. Home Life

In home life, users' demands for smart homes mainly focus on convenience, comfort, and energy efficiency.

Convenience: People hope to easily control various smart devices in their homes, including lights, curtains, door locks, and appliances, through a unified control interface, such as a mobile app or smart speaker. The Matter protocol enhances operational convenience by enabling interoperability among devices, allowing users to avoid installing multiple apps for different brands.

Comfort: Users expect smart home systems to automatically adjust environmental parameters based on different scenarios and times. For example, setting a "wake-up mode" in the morning where curtains automatically open, lights gradually brighten, and music softly plays; or setting a "sleep mode" at night where lights dim, appliances turn off, creating a comfortable sleeping environment. Matter smart homes can meet these needs through device interlinking and preset scene modes.

Energy Efficiency: With the increasing awareness of environmental protection, there is growing attention to the energy-saving features of smart homes. By utilizing smart sensors and the Matter protocol, indoor lighting, temperature, and occupancy can be monitored in real-time, allowing for automatic adjustments to light brightness and appliance operation, thus achieving energy conservation and emission reduction.

### II. Smart Building

Smart buildings encompass multiple systems and have specific demands for Matter smart homes.

Device Interoperability: Smart buildings typically include multiple subsystems such as lighting, air conditioning, and security, provided by different vendors using various protocols. The Matter protocol enables seamless connectivity and interoperability among devices of different brands and types, integrating these subsystems into a unified smart system, thereby enhancing the intelligent management level of the building.

Simplified System Integration: During the construction of buildings, system integration is a complex and time-consuming process. The Matter protocol can simplify this process, reducing integration costs and time. Developers and system integrators can quickly build smart building systems using the Matter protocol without needing to develop separate interfaces and drivers for each device.

Security: Devices in smart buildings are connected to networks, involving a large amount of user privacy and security information. The Matter protocol emphasizes security, employing advanced encryption technologies and authentication mechanisms to ensure secure and reliable communication between devices, preventing unauthorized devices from accessing the system and protecting user privacy and data security.

### III. Healthcare

In the healthcare field, Matter smart homes also have special application demands.

Remote Monitoring and Assistance: For patients with chronic diseases or mobility issues, remote monitoring of their living environment is essential. Matter smart homes can connect various sensors, such as heart rate monitors, blood pressure monitors, and environmental sensors, to transmit data in real-time to healthcare providers or family members, enabling timely detection of abnormalities and prompt action. Additionally, smart home systems can provide assistance functions, such as automatically reminding patients to take medication on time and adjusting the indoor environment based on the patient's condition.

Rehabilitation Environment Optimization: Environmental factors significantly impact patients' recovery outcomes during rehabilitation. Matter smart homes can automatically adjust indoor temperature, humidity, lighting, and other environmental parameters according to patients' rehabilitation needs, creating a suitable recovery environment.

### IV. Commercial Office

The demand for Matter smart homes in commercial office environments mainly focuses on improving work efficiency and management convenience.

Integration of Smart Office Devices: Offices typically have various smart devices, such as smart lighting, smart air conditioning, and smart printers. The Matter protocol enables interconnectivity among these devices, allowing centralized management and control through a unified interface. For instance, lights and air conditioning can be automatically adjusted based on personnel activity in the office area, enhancing energy efficiency and facilitating employee operation.

Meeting Scene Optimization: In meeting rooms, Matter smart homes can set scene modes based on different meeting requirements. For example, in presentation mode, lights dim, the projector automatically turns on, and the sound system adjusts to an appropriate volume; in discussion mode, lights brighten, and microphones automatically activate, creating a conducive meeting environment.

Security and Access Control: Commercial office spaces require strict security and access control. Matter smart homes can implement strict monitoring and control of personnel entry and exit through smart locks, access control systems, and surveillance cameras, ensuring the safety of the office environment.

In summary, Matter smart homes have extensive demands and application potential in home life, smart buildings, healthcare, and commercial offices. With the continuous development and improvement of technology, Matter smart homes will bring more convenience and value to people's lives and work.
