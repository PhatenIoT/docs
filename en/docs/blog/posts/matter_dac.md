# Understanding DAC: What Exactly Is It?
<!-- more -->

In the world governed by the Matter protocol, device manufacturers are now focusing on deeper aspects of competition such as hardware design, interaction methods, content, collaborative capabilities, user experience, scenario applications, brand marketing, cloud services, and security. It can be said that Matter is not just a set of protocol standards but also a certification system where security and privacy are paramount. The security certification between Matter devices and ecosystems forms the foundation of this system.

Feiteng Cloud has developed a comprehensive service system encompassing device testing, device certification, cloud certification, and large-scale production that Matter devices must undergo. Combined with Matter DAC services, Feiteng Cloud is committed to delivering more refined Matter all-in-one solutions to Matter device manufacturers and brand owners.

## Understanding Matter DAC Device Attestation Certificates

DAC stands for Device Attestation Certificate. It is an indispensable part of the process from design to mass production for Matter devices. Every mass-produced Matter device requires a DAC to comply with the requirements of the CSA Connected Home over IP Alliance.

Matter adopts a security model based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The role of DAC is to convince the Matter network that the accessing device is a certified and trusted device. By tracing the certificate chain of the device DAC, users can verify whether the purchased Matter device indeed originates from the manufacturer indicated on the device packaging, thus avoiding inclusion of insecure devices. This certificate mechanism ensures the security of the Matter network and addresses the pain points of inadequate link security in smart home systems. In the absence of DAC, device manufacturers, even if they pass Matter certification, cannot complete the mass production and shipment of Matter devices. Therefore, while DAC benefits the Matter ecosystem, it also increases production thresholds and costs for manufacturers to a certain extent.

As a Matter solution provider, Feiteng Cloud deeply understands the importance of DAC in the mass production of Matter devices.

Currently, Feiteng Cloud can provide complete DAC services for manufacturers in the testing and production stages, helping them address urgent needs. Furthermore, for manufacturers who have already chosen Feiteng Cloud's Matter all-in-one solutions, Feiteng Cloud can also provide supporting production tools to facilitate scaled production.

Matter, as a unified application standard, already has over 500 companies as Matter members, bringing not only standardized execution standards but also significant business opportunities. It is projected that starting from 2023, the number of global Matter devices will experience exponential growth, thereby generating substantial demand for Matter DAC.

## Accelerating the Deployment of Matter Smart Homes

As an emerging standard in the smart home sector, Matter aims to enhance compatibility among smart home products from different manufacturers, different product categories, and different ecosystem platforms. Previously, achieving cross-platform operation for smart home devices required additional configuration, but now supporting Matter enables seamless cross-platform and cross-brand compatibility. The software-hardware decoupling brought by the Matter standard will revolutionize business models in the smart home industry.

As a revolutionary innovation in smart homes, Matter was developed by engineers from many of the world's top companies and enjoys strong support from international giants like Apple, Google, and Amazon. The timing of Matter's market debut is perfect, as smart homes are now entering a period of widespread adoption.
