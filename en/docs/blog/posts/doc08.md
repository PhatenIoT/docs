* Traditional Smart Products: The price range for traditional smart products is quite broad, including both affordable entry-level products and more complex, high-quality high-end products. Overall, the prices of traditional smart products are relatively stable, allowing consumers to choose products that fit their budget.
* Other Smart Products: The price differences among other smart products can vary significantly. Some emerging smart products, due to advanced technologies and materials, may be priced higher; while simpler smart products tend to be more affordable. For instance, small smart products like smart bands and smart plugs are relatively budget-friendly, whereas larger smart products like smart robots and smart refrigerators tend to be more expensive.

### Installation and Debugging Costs
* Matter Smart Products: Installation and debugging are relatively simple, generally not requiring professional technicians. Users can complete the installation themselves. Matter smart products typically use standardized interfaces and connection methods, making it easy to connect to home networks. However, if the user's home network environment is poor, upgrading and optimizing the network may incur additional costs.
* Traditional Smart Products: The installation and debugging of traditional smart products can be more complex. Some large traditional smart products, such as smart TVs and smart refrigerators, require professional technicians for installation and debugging, increasing the user's installation costs. Additionally, the connection methods for traditional smart products may not be as convenient, requiring complex wiring and setup by the user.
* Other Smart Products: The installation and debugging costs for other smart products vary by product. Some simple smart products, like smart plugs and smart sensors, are very easy to install and debug, allowing users to do it themselves; while more complex smart products, such as smart security systems and smart home theaters, require professional technicians for installation and debugging, leading to higher costs.

### Usage and Maintenance Costs
* Matter Smart Products: The usage and maintenance costs are relatively low. Matter smart products utilize advanced technology and energy-saving designs, resulting in lower energy consumption, which can save users on electricity bills. Moreover, software updates and maintenance for Matter smart products are convenient, allowing users to automatically download and install updates via the internet, keeping device performance and functionality continuously improved.
* Traditional Smart Products: The usage and maintenance costs of traditional smart products may be higher. Some traditional smart products have higher energy consumption, leading to increased electricity bills during use. Additionally, software updates and maintenance for traditional smart products can be relatively difficult, requiring users to contact manufacturers or professional technicians, which increases both usage costs and time costs.
* Other Smart Products: The usage and maintenance costs for other smart products also vary by product. Some smart products have low energy consumption and maintenance costs, such as smart bands and smart watches; while larger smart products, like smart air conditioners and smart washing machines, tend to have higher energy consumption and maintenance costs.
