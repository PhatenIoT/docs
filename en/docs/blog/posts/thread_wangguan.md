## Basic Principles of Thread Gateway
As a bridge, the Thread gateway connects Thread devices within a local network to the internet or other IP networks. It typically features the following functionalities:

Thread Network Connectivity: The gateway can connect to Thread networks within a local area network (LAN) and communicate with various Thread devices.

IP Network Connectivity: The gateway connects to the internet or local LAN, enabling Thread devices within the LAN to access internet resources or be remotely managed and controlled.

Security and Management: Gateways usually integrate security authentication, encrypted communication, and device management functionalities to ensure the security and stability of network communication.

Data Forwarding and Processing: The gateway processes and forwards data from Thread devices so that it can be recognized and utilized by internet applications or other network devices.
