# How to Choose Target Modules?
Regardless of the product being made, most manufacturers choose smart modules to facilitate production and reduce costs, as they are plug-and-play, making the process quick and easy! So how do we determine what kind of modules to use to assemble our products?

### 1. Clarify Device Function Requirements

First, determine the main functions of the finished device. For example, if you want to create a smart temperature control system, you will need a temperature sensor module to obtain temperature data, and possibly a control module (such as a relay module) to control heating or cooling devices.

List the essential functions that the device must have, which will help filter out the types of modules that can achieve these functions. For instance, for a wireless data transmission device, you need to consider selecting the appropriate wireless communication module, such as Wi-Fi modules, Bluetooth modules, or Zigbee modules, depending on the specific requirements for transmission distance, speed, and power consumption.

### 2. Consider Module Performance Parameters

Accuracy: If it involves measurement modules, such as sensor modules, accuracy is crucial. For example, in industrial control scenarios, a pressure sensor module may require an accuracy of up to 0.1% or even higher to ensure measurement accuracy. In some ordinary consumer products, the accuracy requirement may be relatively lower, around 3% to 5%.

Speed: For modules that process data or communicate, speed is a key performance indicator. For example, in high-speed data acquisition systems, the sampling speed of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) module needs to be fast enough. If you want to capture audio signals, a sampling rate of at least 44.1kHz is generally required; for some high-frequency signal monitoring scenarios, the ADC module may need to have a sampling speed of millions of samples per second or even higher. The transmission speed of communication modules is also important; for example, the transmission speed of a 5G communication module is far higher than that of a 3G module, which can meet the demand for rapid transmission of large data volumes.

Power Consumption: For mobile devices or devices powered by batteries, the power consumption of the module directly affects the device's battery life. For instance, a low-power Bluetooth (BLE) module can have power consumption as low as microamps in sleep mode, making it suitable for applications in smart bands and other devices with strict power consumption requirements. On the other hand, some high-performance graphics processing modules or high-power communication modules may have higher power consumption, so it's essential to consider whether the device's power supply can meet their needs.

### 3. Module Compatibility

Electrical Compatibility: Ensure that the module's operating voltage, current, and other electrical parameters match the device's power system. For example, most microcontroller modules operate at a voltage between 3.3V and 5V. If the voltage provided by the power system does not meet the module's requirements, it may damage the module. Additionally, the input and output signal levels of the module must be compatible with other connected modules or circuits. For example, digital logic levels are generally divided into TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) and CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) levels, and when connecting modules with different levels, level conversion may be necessary.

Communication Protocol Compatibility: If the device requires multiple modules to work together, the communication protocols between these modules must be compatible. For example, when using a main control microcontroller module to connect multiple sensor modules and actuator modules, they may need to communicate through protocols such as SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), or UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter). Ensure that the selected modules all support the same communication protocol and can match in terms of communication speed and data format.

### 4. Module Size and Physical Interface

Size Limitations: Choose modules of appropriate size based on the design and internal layout of the finished device. In some miniaturized electronic products, such as smartwatches or micro drones, the size requirements for modules are very strict. For example, you need to select compact accelerometer and gyroscope modules to fit into the limited space inside the watch.

Physical Interface Types: The physical interfaces of the modules should facilitate connection with other components of the device. Common interfaces include pin interfaces, header interfaces, USB interfaces, HDMI interfaces, etc. **If the device uses a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design, selecting modules with appropriate pin spacing and quantity will facilitate soldering and wiring**. For example, for PCBs using surface mount technology (SMT), it is best to choose surface-mounted modules to reduce production costs and improve assembly efficiency.

### 5. Cost Budget

Cost is an important consideration when selecting modules. There can be significant price differences among modules from different brands, with varying performance and functions. Choose suitable modules based on the market positioning and cost budget of the device. For example, for a low-cost smart home sensor node, you can choose some cost-effective domestic sensor modules; for high-end industrial automation equipment, you may need to select higher-quality and more stable imported modules, which may be more expensive. Additionally, consider the procurement costs, transportation costs, and potential after-sales maintenance costs of the modules.

### 6. Reliability and Stability

Adaptability to Working Environment: Consider the environmental conditions that the module can adapt to, including temperature, humidity, vibration, and electromagnetic interference. For example, in automotive electronic devices, the selected electronic modules need to operate stably within a wide temperature range of -40℃ to 125℃ and be able to withstand strong electromagnetic interference from components like engines. For outdoor environmental monitoring devices, choose modules with good waterproof and dustproof performance to ensure they can operate normally in harsh natural environments.

Quality and Brand Reputation: Choose module suppliers with good quality and brand reputation. Generally, well-known brands' modules undergo stricter quality testing and reliability verification. For example, some internationally renowned brands' power modules perform better in overload protection and output stability, which can reduce the risk of device failure. Additionally, by reviewing other users' evaluations and feedback, you can gain insights into the reliability of the modules in actual use.

### 7. Technical Support and Documentation

High-quality module suppliers typically provide comprehensive technical support and detailed documentation. These documents include user manuals, data sheets, example codes (for programmable modules), etc. For example, for a complex programmable FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) module, detailed technical documentation and example codes can help developers quickly get started with functionality development and debugging. Moreover, being able to receive timely technical support from the supplier when encountering issues can significantly shorten the device development cycle and resolve potential failure risks.
