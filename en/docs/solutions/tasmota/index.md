## tasmota Introduction

Tasmota is an open source firmware for Espressif ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32- s or ESP32- c3 chipset devices, created and maintained by Theo Arends. The project started with the Sonoff-MQTT-OTA and commit on January 25, 2016 by Theo Arends. The goal is to provide MQTT and 'Over the Air' or OTA firmware for ESP8266-based ITEAD Sonoff devices.

What started as a simple way to hack the cloud-bound Sonoff Basic (one of the first cheap and easy-to-use smart home devices on the market) into locally-controlled devices has evolved into a full-fledged ecosystem for virtually any ESP8266-based device.
