#  Matter Pre-burned DAC Module Application Solution

## 1. Introduction

The DAC is an indispensable part of the process from design to mass production of Matter devices. Every mass-produced Matter device requires a DAC. Without a DAC, even if the device manufacturer passes the CSA Matter certification, it cannot complete the mass production and shipment of Matter devices.

Feitengyun provides pre-burned DAC modules, which are pre-burned with DAC when they leave the factory. You can use this module to develop and certify Matter products, and legally access the Matter ecosystem.
